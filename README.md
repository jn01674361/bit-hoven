# GENERATE MUSIC BY 
#
# 1) Deleting all files in the data-folder, if there any.
# 2) Deleting the file called "weights.hdf5", if there is such a file.
# 3) Put your midi-files in the midi_songs folder.
# 4) Start Jupyter Notebook in the bit-hoven-folder. 
# 5) Run the section at the bottom of the train_model_from_start notebook.
# 6) Find the most recent file whose name starts with "weights-improvement-" and change its name to "weights.hdf5".
# 7) Run the section at the bottom of the generate_music notebook.
# 8) You will now find a new midi-file in your bit-hoven folder.
